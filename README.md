### COVID — 19 affected every corner of the world, but the intensity and outcomes varied significantly across regions and countries. Using data-driven analysis, this article explores how factors like Human Development Index(HDI), demographics, and testing rates influenced the infection and fatality rates during the pandemic.
<br>

## Key Findings
### 1. Global Trends :
  * Europe and Asia were the most affected continents in terms of total cases and total deaths.
  * Country with high HDI had significantly high infection rate and fatalities per population.
### 2.  Case Fatality Rate(CFR) :
  * The CFR(fatalities per reported cases) showed little variation across countries regardless of their HDI.
### 3. Demographics and Fatality :
  * Countries with higher life expectancy and a larger percentage of populations aged 65+ experienced higher fatalities per population.
### 4. Testing Rates :
  * High HDI countries also had significantly higher testing rates, which likely contributed to higher reported case numbers.

Dual-axis line chart compares cumulative cases per 100,000 and fatalities per 100,000 across HDI categories over time.
<br>
* **Observations:**
  * **High infection and fatality rates :** Very high and high HDI countries experienced significantly higher cumulative cases and fatalities per 100,000 compared to medium and low HDI countries.
  * **Initial impact :** These countries saw sharp initial spikes in both cases and deaths, indicating the heavy early burden of the pandemic.

### **3. Relationship Between HDI and Cases.**

### **4. Testing Rates and HDI**

A **stacked bar chart** compares the percentage of total tests and cases per population across HDI categories.
<br>
* **Observations:**
  * Very high and high HDI countries have disproportionately higher testing rates, with total tests surpassing their population sizes due to multiple tests per individual.
  * Infection rates also peak in very high HDI countries, suggesting that effective testing captured a more accurate count of cases.
  * Low HDI countries report far lower rates of both testing and infections, possibly due to limited testing infrastructure and underreporting.

### **5. Fatality Rate by HDI and Population Demographics** 
**The following visuals focus on fatality trends:**

A clustered column chart compares the average fatality rate per 100k population with the percentage of the population aged 65+ for each HDI category.
* **Observation:**
  * Higher percentages of older populations correlate with higher fatalities per population.

### 5.3 Correlation Between HDI and Case Fatality Rate (CFR)

This scatter plot examines the relationship between HDI and case fatality rate (CFR), exploring whether HDI influences the proportion of fatalities among reported cases in different countries.
* **Observation:**
  * No significant relationship was observed between HDI and CFR.
  * Countries reported similar case fatality rates regardless of their HDI classification, suggesting other factors, like healthcare policies or the nature of the virus, played a more substantial role.

### **6. Life Expectancy and Fatalities**

A bubble scatter plot explores the relationship between life expectancy and fatalities per population, with bubble size representing the percentage of the population aged 65+.
* **Observation:**
  * Developed countries, with high life expectancy and older populations, faced higher fatalities per population despite lower fatality rates per reported case.
 
## Conclusion

1. **Infection and Fatality Rates:**
   - High and very high HDI countries experienced higher infection rates and fatalities per population compared to medium and low HDI countries.
   - These countries faced greater initial challenges during the pandemic due to their high population density, global connectivity, and larger proportions of older populations.

2. **Case Fatality Rate (CFR):**
   - Despite disparities in infection rates, the CFR remained consistent across all HDI categories, indicating that countries managed to maintain similar fatality proportions among reported cases.
   - The scatter plot analysis revealed no significant relationship between HDI and CFR, suggesting that other factors — such as healthcare policies, early interventions, or viral characteristics — played a larger role in determining outcomes.

3. Demographics and Fatalities:

   - Countries with higher life expectancy and larger percentages of populations aged 65+ faced higher fatalities per population.
   - This demographic factor is a critical driver of fatality rates in high HDI countries.
     
4. Testing and Reporting:

   - High HDI countries conducted more tests, which likely contributed to higher reported cases and provided better visibility into the pandemic’s spread.

The initial surge in numbers highlighted how contagious the COVID-19 disease was. Regardless of a country’s level of development, a pandemic of this nature can easily cause both short-term and long-term impacts on humanity. To prevent encountering such severe threats in the future, proper precautions and planning are essential.
