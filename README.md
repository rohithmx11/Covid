### COVID â€” 19 affected every corner of the world, but the intensity and outcomes varied significantly across regions and countries. Using data-driven analysis, this article explores how factors like Human Development Index(HDI), demographics, and testing rates influenced the infection and fatality rates during the pandemic.
<br>

## Key Findings
### 1. Global Trends :
  * Europe and Asia were the most affected continents in terms of total cases and total deaths.
  * Country with high HDI had significantly high infection rate and fatalities per population.
### 2.  Case Fatality Rate(CFR) :
  * The CFR(fatalities per reported cases) showed little variation across countries regardless of their HDI.
### 3. Demographics and Fatality :
  * Countries with higher life expectancy and a larger percentage of populations aged 65+ experienced higher fatalities per population.
### 4. Testing Rates :
  * High HDI countries also had significantly higher testing rates, which likely contributed to higher reported case numbers.

## Visualizing The Impact
### **1.Global Infection Trends Across Continents.**

This line chart compares cumulative cases across continents over time, highlighting Europe and Asia as the most affected regions.

Dual-axis line chart compares cumulative cases per 100,000 and fatalities per 100,000 across HDI categories over time.
<br>
* **Observations:**
  * **High infection and fatality rates :** Very high and high HDI countries experienced significantly higher cumulative cases and fatalities per 100,000 compared to medium and low HDI countries.
  * **Initial impact :** These countries saw sharp initial spikes in both cases and deaths, indicating the heavy early burden of the pandemic.

This scatter plot reveals a strong correlation between HDI and total cases per million. Higher HDI countries, with better healthcare systems and testing infrastructure, reported more infections.
